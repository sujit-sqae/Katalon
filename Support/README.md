Scenario 2: Mobile Application Automation

To perform this automation testing, I used Katalon Studio as a testing tool.

#Project Setup
1. Install Appium [I prefer Appium version 1.22.0 because I found it to be most compatible with any OS version of Mac or Windows].
2. Install Katalon Studio
3. Install the given apk on your mobile device
4. Mobile device deleoper options should be ON, connected through a cable, and USB debugging should be ON [device settings need to be changed for different OS, models, and brands]
5. Open the "Source Code" folder in Katalon Studio
6. Expand "Test Suits and click on "Calculator"
7. Now go to "Action" > "Run" > "Android"
8. From the pop-up, select your device and click on "OK"


Other Features:
1. A test report will be automatically generated inside the Reports folder
